<h1>Backend: qmail</h1>

<hr />

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>

<li>The qmail home directory is compiled into the program, and defaults
to <tt>/var/qmail</tt>, but may be overridden by <tt>$QMAILHOME</tt>.

<li>Messages are delivered through the executable named in
<tt>$QMAILQUEUE</tt>, or <tt>$QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-queue</tt> if it is
not set.

<li>If <tt>qmail-queue</tt> exits non-zero, the qmail backend looks for
an error message in <tt>$QQERRMSG_#</tt>, where <tt>#</tt> is the exit
code of <tt>qmail-queue</tt>.  As usual, exit codes between 11 and 40
indicate permanent errors, and all others indicate temporary errors.

<li>The qmail-queue PID is logged in success messages for correlation
with the qmail logs.
