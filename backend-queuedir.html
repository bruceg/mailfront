<h1>Backend: queuedir</h1>

<hr />

<p>This backend writes messages into individual files in a named
directory. The files are written to temporary files with unique
filenames and moved into the final directory when the contents are
complete.</p>

<p>The file format is as follows:</p>

<ol>

  <li>The envelope sender address, followed by a NUL byte.</li>
  <li>A list of envelope recipient addresses, each followed by a NUL byte.</li>
  <li>A terminating NUL byte.</li>
  <li>The full message data.</li>

</ol>
