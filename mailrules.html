<h1>Mail Rules Specification</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Selection</h2>

<p>The use of mail rules is controlled by the environment variable
<tt>$MAILRULES</tt>.  This variable specifies the path to the mail rules
file.  If <tt>$MAILRULES</tt> is set but the path that it points to
cannot be opened, processing will fail with a temporary error.  There is
no default value -- if it is not set, mail rules processing is
disabled.</p>

<p>The rules listed are applied <i>before</i> any other sender or
recipient processing is done (such as checking against qmail's
badmailfrom file).</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Each rule in the file occupies a single line and has exactly the same
format.  Each line starts with one of "k", "d", or "z" corresponding to
accept, defer, or reject.  Empty lines and lines starting with any other
character are ignored.  The remainder of the line consists of a series
of fields seperated by colons (":").  The fields are: <ol>

<li><b>Sender</b>: A pattern applied to the envelope sender address.

<li><b>Recipient</b>: A pattern applied to the envelope recipient
address.

<li><b>Response</b>: The response message that will be given to the
client with the numerical code.  The default for this message depends on
the line's prefix.

<li><b>Data Bytes</b>: Reduces the maximum message size to the lesser of
the current limit (as set at startup by <tt>$DATABYTES</tt>) and the
specified number.  This message size limit is reset to its original
value before after each message.  If empty or missing, no changes are
made.

<li><b>Relay Client</b>: If present, the current recipient address is
suffixed with this string.  Only useful for "k" rules.

<li><b>Environment</b>: Environment variables to set as a result of
matching this rule.  This field contains a list of assignments seperated
by commas.  Each assignment is formatted as <tt>NAME="VALUE"</tt>.

</dl>

</ol></p>

<h2>Escaping</h2>

<p>The following escape sequences are recognized both in the message and
patterns: <ul>

<li><tt>\n</tt> newline (replaced with a CR+LF pair on output)

<li><tt>\###</tt> character with octal value ### (exactly 3 digits)

<li><tt>\\</tt> backslash

<li><tt>\:</tt> colon

</ul></p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>

<h3>Pattern Syntax</h3>

<p>A pattern is a string of stars and non-stars.  It matches any
concatenation of strings matched by all the stars and non-stars in the
same order.  A non-star matches itself.  A star before the end of
pattern matches any string that does not include the next character in
pattern. A star at the end of pattern matches any string.  Patterns
containing only "<tt>*</tt>" match anything.  <b>Note:</b> An empty
pattern matches <i>only</i> the empty string.</p>

<h3>Special Patterns</h3>

<p>The following patterns are treated specially: <dl>

<dt><tt>[[@<i>filename</i>]]</tt> <dd>Matches the domain portion of the
address against the control file named <tt><i>filename</i></tt>.
Typical uses would be "<tt>[[@rcpthosts]]</tt>" and
"<tt>[[@morercpthosts.cdb]]</tt>" in the recipient field.

<dt><tt>[[<i>filename</i>]]</tt> <dd>Matches the entire address against
the control file named <tt><i>filename</i></tt>.  A typical use would be
"<tt>[[badmailfrom]]</tt>" in the sender field.

</dl> If <tt><i>filename</i></tt> ends with <tt>.cdb</tt>, the control
file is opened as a CDB file.  Addresses are translated to lower-case
before doing CDB lookups.  Otherwise, control files are plain text
lists, with one entry per line.  Empty lines and lines starting with
"<tt>#</tt>" are ignored.  Lines starting with "<tt>@</tt>" match only
the domain portion of the address.  All comparisons are case
insensitive.  Missing CDB files are silently ignored.  Missing text
files cause an error message at startup.</p>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>Each rule is applied in the order they are listed in the rules file
until one matches.  At that point, the command that triggered the rule
search is accepted, deferred, or rejected depending on the rule type.
If the sender is not accepted, no recipients can be accepted, as usual.
As long as at least one recipient is accepted the message data may be
accepted.</p>

<p>Rules with a recipient pattern of <tt>*</tt> will be tested when the
client transmits the sender address.  Otherwise rules are be tested when
the client transmits the recipient address.</p>

<h2>qmail Rules</h2>

<p>The following rules provide the functionality available in
qmail-smtpd.  Please note that the qmail validation routines already
provide this functionality.  These rules are listed for illustrative
purposes only.

<pre>
z[[/var/qmail/control/badmailfrom]]:*:sorry, your envelope sender is in my badmailfrom list (#5.7.1)
k*:[[@/var/qmail/control/rcpthosts]]
k*:[[@/var/qmail/control/morercpthosts.cdb]]
</pre></p>
