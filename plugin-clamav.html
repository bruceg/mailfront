<h1>Plugin: clamav</h1>

<hr />

<p>This plugin scans messages against a <a
href="http://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a> server.  If the message data is
detected as having a virus, the message is rejected, and the error
response contains the virus name as detected by ClamAV.  This scanner
only operates over TCP/IP sockets (either remotely or locally).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This file causes mailfront to save messages to temporary
files.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<dl>

<dt><tt>$CLAMD_HOST</tt></dt> <dd>The hostname of the ClamAV scanner.
If this name resolves to multiple IP addresses, all of them are tried in
sequence (starting at a random point) until one scans the message.</dd>

<dt><tt>$CLAMD_PORT</tt></dt> <dd>Use this port number for the
command/response data. (defaults to 3310)</dd>

<dt><tt>$CLAMD_TIMEOUT</tt></dt> <dd>The maximum amount of time to wait
for a response from the ClamAD scanner, in milliseconds. (defaults to
5000)</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Sender Action</h2>

<p>None</p>

<h2>Recipient Action</h2>

<p>None</p>

<h2>Data Action</h2>

<p>None</p>

<h2>Message Action</h2>

<p>The message is scanned when all the data has been completely
transmitted (to prevent timeout issues with the ClamAV server).</p>
