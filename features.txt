Features common to all SMTP back-ends:

- Handles either bare NL or RFC 821/2821 compliant CR/NL end-of-line
  conventions.

- Drops messages that exceed $DATABYTES bytes in the body.

- Times out connections after $TIMEOUT seconds of inactivity (defaults
  to 1200).

- Counts the number of "Received:" and "Delivered-To:" headers, and
  rejects the message if more than 100 of either are seen
  (configurable by $MAXHOPS).

- All error responses are logged.

Features of the smtpd-qmail back-end:

- Delivers messages through $QMAILQUEUE, or qmail-queue if it's not set.

- Verifies sender addresses against control/badmailfrom.

- Verifies recipient addresses against control/rcpthosts.

- Handles $RELAYCLIENT the same as qmail-smtpd.

- Logs qmail-queue PID.
