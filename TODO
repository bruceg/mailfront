- Write install document.

- Add new control files: matchmailfrom and matchrcptto
  - Each line contains either + (accept) or - (reject) followed by a
    pattern
  - The patterns are used one-by-one until a match is found

- Build up TLS support.

- Use lib/cli for all executables

- Build a common line-driven protocol main loop, which does:
    set_timeout();
    if (!startup(argc, argv)) return 0;
    respond_ready();
    while (ibuf_getstr_crlf(&inbuf, &line))
      handle_line(&line);
    if (ibuf_timedout(&inbuf))
      respond_timedout();

- smtpfront:

  - When verifying senders, check if $DOMAIN(?) is set, and only allow
    sender addresses from that domain.

  - Implement a session timeout in addition to the I/O timeout.

  - Add RFC 1893/2034 enhanced status codes to all responses.

  - Add support for RFC 2487 STARTTLS

  - Segment the SMTP code into seperate files

  - Add some information about authentication into the headers (?)

  - Export CVM data after authentication, to allow programs like
    qmail-qfilter to pick it up.

  - Handle $LOCALIPHOST (all back-ends): rewrite envelope recipient
    addresses of the form box@[a.b.c.d], where a.b.c.d is a local IP
    address, to box@$LOCALIPHOST. (low priority)

- pop3front:

  - Add support for CAPA command (RFC 2449)

  - Properly re-parse flags in cmd_quit

  - Split the generic protocol handling bits from pop3front-maildir (low
    priority -- who wants anything but maildir?)
