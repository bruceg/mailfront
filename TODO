- Add documentation for QMQP and QMTP back ends.

- Add echo/reject back-ends for QMQP and QMTP, and add tests using them.

- Add negation to patterns:
  - Each leading ! increments a counter (parsed when parsing the rules,
    not when using the pattern)
  - If the counter is odd, negate the result of the pattern match
  - Check for both a zero negate counter and a pattern of "*" when
    deciding if it's a sender-only rule.

- Write install document.

- Build up TLS support.

- Use lib/cli for all executables

- Build a common line-driven protocol main loop, which does:
    set_timeout();
    if (!startup(argc, argv)) return 0;
    respond_ready();
    while (ibuf_getstr_crlf(&inbuf, &line))
      handle_line(&line);
    if (ibuf_timedout(&inbuf))
      respond_timedout();

- Tests:
  - Test application of environment variables in mail rules
  - Test rcpthosts/morercpthosts.cdb normal/wildcard behavior in
    smtpfront-qmail.

- smtpfront:

  - Rename handle_* to std_handle_*, and let the backend code override
    handle_*.

  - Build a shared routine for breaking out the domain name.

  - When verifying senders, check if $DOMAIN(?) is set, and only allow
    sender addresses from that domain.

  - Add RFC 2034/3463 enhanced status codes to all responses.

  - Add support for RFC 2487 STARTTLS

  - Segment the SMTP code into seperate files

  - Add some information about authentication into the headers (?)

  - Export CVM data after authentication, to allow programs like
    qmail-qfilter to pick it up.

  - Handle $LOCALIPHOST (all back-ends): rewrite envelope recipient
    addresses of the form box@[a.b.c.d], where a.b.c.d is a local IP
    address, to box@$LOCALIPHOST. (low priority)

- pop3front:

  - Add support for CAPA command (RFC 2449)

  - Properly re-parse flags in cmd_quit

  - Split the generic protocol handling bits from pop3front-maildir (low
    priority -- who wants anything but maildir?)
