</p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This package contains customizeable network front-ends for mail
servers.  Right now the on protocol that is handled is SMTP, but this
package may be extended to deal with QMQP, QMTP, and even POP3 or
IMAP.</p>

<p>The code is divided into two sections: front-ends and back-ends.
The front-end code handles the low-level details of the protocol.  The
back-end code handles the validation and delivery details in a
protocol-independant fashion.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This package is ready to use, but you will have to make some
modifications to existing configurations to do so.
<tt>smtpfront-qmail</tt> is a nearly complete drop-in replacement for
<tt>qmail-smtpd</tt>.
