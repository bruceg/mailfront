<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The <tt>mailfront</tt> program acts as a driver container, loading up
a protocol module, a backend module, and a list of plugins at run time.
All protocols are completely interchangeable, as are the backends.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The protocol and backend modules are specified as the first two
command line arguments.  The remainder of the command line arguments
specify lists of plugins.</p>

<p>If <tt>$PLUGINS</tt> is set, it contains a list of plugins, separated
by colons, that will be loaded after the plugins specified on the
command line.  If <tt>$MODULE_PATH</tt> is set, it specifies the
directory in which modules will be loaded.  Otherwise, the built in
module path will be used, which is configured by editing the file
<tt>conf-modules</tt> before building.</p>

<p>Each plugin name may be one of following three forms:</p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>-name</tt></dt> <dd>The previously loaded plugin called
"<tt>name</tt>" is removed from list.  The special name "<tt>*</tt>"
means to empty the entire list.</dd>

<dt><tt>+name</tt></dt> <dd>The named plugin is loaded and placed at the
front of the list.</dd>

<dt><tt>name</tt></dt> <dd>The named plugin is loaded and placed at the
back of the list.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Note that in both cases where a plugin is loaded, it is first removed
from the list if it was previously loaded.  It is not possible for the
same module to be loaded multiple times.</p>

<p>A configuration that would match previous installations of mailfront
using the qmail backend would use the following list of plugins:</p>

<pre>check-fqdn:counters:mailrules:relayclient:cvm-validate:qmail-validate:add-received:patterns:accept-sender</pre>

<p>The included <tt>*front-qmail</tt> shell script wrappers for the
<tt>mailfront</tt> program are preconfigured to load the above list of
plugins before any of their command line arguments or
<tt>$PLUGINS</tt>.</p>

<h2>Protocols</h2>

<p>The protocol module is responsible for all interaction at the network
I/O level with the client.  It links into the system by calling down to
the handler wrappers provided by mailfront, which in turn dispatches
calls to the plugins and finally the backend.</p>

<p>The following protocols are available:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="protocol-qmqp.html">qmqp</a></li>

<li><a href="protocol-qmtp.html">qmtp</a></li>

<li><a href="protocol-smtp.html">smtp</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>Plugins hook into the mail system at 5 main points:</p>

<ol> <li>when the system is started or reset,</li> <li>when the sender
address is received,</li> <li>when a recipient address is received,</li>
<li>when data is received, and</li> <li>when the message is
completed.</li> </ol>

<p>At each of these events, mailfront goes through the list of loaded
plugins. For each plugin that has a handler for such an event, mailfront
calls that handler.  If the handler returns no response, control passes
to the next handler, otherwise no further handlers are called.  If the
returned code was an error, it is passed back to the protocol
immediately, which will present it to the client.  If the sender or
recipient handlers of all the plugins return no response, the address is
considered rejected, and it is not passed on to the back end. This is
done to prevent the default configuration from being an open relay.
Plugins may modify the sender or recipient address, but not the data
(yet).</p>

<p>The following plugins are included in the main package:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="plugin-accept.html">accept</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-accept-recipient.html">accept-recipient</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-accept-sender.html">accept-sender</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-add-received.html">add-received</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-check-fqdn.html">check-fqdn</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-counters.html">counters</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-cvm-validate.html">cvm-validate</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-qmail-validate.html">qmail-validate</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-reject.html">reject</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-relayclient.html">relayclient</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-require-auth.html">require-auth</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Backends</h2>

<p>The backend is the final stage in incoming mail handling, and is
responsible for passing the message on to the mail system.  It is
invoked only if no plugin returned an error result.  Other than the
above two differences, the backend is structured identically to the
plugins described above.</p>

<p>The following backends are available:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="backend-echo.html">echo</a></li>

<li><a href="backend-qmail.html">qmail</a></li>

</ul>
