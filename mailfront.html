<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This package contains customizeable network front-ends for mail
servers.  Right now the only protocols that are handled are SMTP and
POP3, but this package is likely to be extended to deal with QMQP and
QMTP, and potentially even IMAP.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This package is ready to use, but you will have to make some
modifications to existing configurations to do so.
<tt>smtpfront-qmail</tt> is a nearly complete drop-in replacement for
<tt>qmail-smtpd</tt>, and <tt>pop3front-auth</tt> and
<tt>pop3front-maildir</tt> are replacements for <tt>qmail-popup</tt>
and <tt>qmail-pop3d</tt>.
