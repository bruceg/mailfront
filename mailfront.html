<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The mailfront program acts as a driver container, loading up a
protocol module, a backend module, and a list of plugins at run time.
All protocols are completely interchangeable, as are the backends.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The protocol and backend modules are specified as the first two
command line arguments.  The remainder of the command line arguments
specify lists of plugins.</p>

<p>If <tt>$PLUGINS</tt> is set, it contains a list of plugins, separated
by colons, that will be loaded after the plugins specified on the
command line.  If <tt>$MODULE_PATH</tt> is set, it specifies the
directory in which modules will be loaded.  Otherwise, the built in
module path will be used, which is configured by editing the file
<tt>conf-modules</tt> before building.</p>

<p>A configuration that would match previous installations of mailfront
using the qmail backend would be to set:</p>

<pre>PLUGINS=check-fqdn:counters:mailrules:relayclient:qmail-validate:cvm-validate:add-received:patterns:accept-sender</pre>

<p>Also, if <tt>$REQUIRE_AUTH</tt> was set previously, the
<tt>require-auth</tt> plugin would go at the front of the above
list.</p>

<h2>Protocols</h2>

<p>The protocol module is responsible for all interaction at the network
I/O level with the client.  It links into the system by calling down to
the handler wrappers provided by mailfront, which in turn dispatches
calls to the plugins and finally the backend.</p>

<p>The following protocols are available:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="protocol-qmqp.html">qmqp</a></li>

<li><a href="protocol-qmtp.html">qmtp</a></li>

<li><a href="protocol-smtp.html">smtp</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>Plugins hook into the mail system at 3 main points:</p>

<ol> <li>when the sender address is received,</li> <li>when a recipient
address is received,</li> <li>when data is received.</li> </ol>

<p>At each of these events, mailfront goes through the list of loaded
plugins. For each plugin that has a handler for such an event, mailfront
calls that handler.  If the handler returns no response, control passes
to the next handler, otherwise no further handlers are called.  If the
returned code was an error, it is passed back to the protocol
immediately, which will present it to the client.  If the sender or
recipient handlers of all the plugins return no response, the address is
considered rejected, and it is not passed on to the back end. This is
done to prevent the default configuration from being an open relay.
Plugins may modify the sender or recipient address, but not the data
(yet).</p>

<p>The following plugins are included in the main package:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="plugin-accept.html">accept</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-accept-recipient.html">accept-recipient</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-accept-sender.html">accept-sender</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-add-received.html">add-received</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-check-fqdn.html">check-fqdn</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-counters.html">counters</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-cvm-validate.html">cvm-validate</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-mailrules.html">mailrules</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-patterns.html">patterns</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-qmail-validate.html">qmail-validate</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-reject.html">reject</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-relayclient.html">relayclient</a></li>

<li><a href="plugin-require-auth.html">require-auth</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Backends</h2>

<p>The backend is the final stage in incoming mail handling, and is
responsible for passing the message on to the mail system.  It is
invoked only if no plugin returned an error result.  Other than the
above two differences, the backend is structured identically to the
plugins described above.</p>

<p>The following backends are available:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="backend-echo.html">echo</a></li>

<li><a href="backend-qmail.html">qmail</a></li>

</ul>
