</p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This package contains customizeable network front-ends for mail
servers.  Right now the only protocol that is handled is SMTP, but
this package is likely to be extended to deal with QMQP and QMTP, and
potentially even POP3 or IMAP.</p>

<p>The code is divided into two sections: front-ends and back-ends.
The front-end code handles the low-level details of the protocol.  The
back-end code handles the validation and delivery details in a
protocol-independant fashion.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This package is ready to use, but you will have to make some
modifications to existing configurations to do so.
<tt>smtpfront-qmail</tt> is a nearly complete drop-in replacement for
<tt>qmail-smtpd</tt>.
