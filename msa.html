<h1>Message Submission Agent</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>An MSA (message submission agent) is a mail component specifically
designed to accept mail submitted by an MUA (message user agent, or mail
client) for further delivery or relaying.  This is in contrast to a MTA
(message transfer agent) which is designed to accept mail from other
MTAs primarily for local delivery.  The most important standard
governing the behavior of an MSA is <a
href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2476.html">RFC 2476</a>.</p>

<p>In MailFront, enabling MSA mode is accomplished by setting the
<tt>$MSA</tt> environment variable.  When set, the following operational
changes are made:<ul>

<li>If <tt>$DEFAULTHOST</tt> is set, all envelope addresses without a
host name have <tt>@$DEFAULTHOST</tt> appended to them.

<li>If <tt>$DEFAULTDOMAIN</tt> is set, all envelope addresses without a
full domain name have <tt>.$DEFAULTDOMAIN</tt> appended to them.

<li>All envelope addresses (excluding the null sender) are required to
have a fully qualified domain name.

</ul></p>

<p>Message submission is currently an incomplete work-in-progress.</p>

<tr> <th>Section</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Status</th> </tr>

<tr> <th colspan="3">Requirements</th> </tr>

<tr> <td>3.2</td> <td>A null return path, that is, MAIL FROM:<>, is
permitted and MUST be accepted. (MUAs need to generate null return-path
messages for a variety of reasons, including disposition
notifications.)</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>4.1</td> <td>Unless covered by a more precise response code,
response code 554 is to be used to reject a MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, or DATA
command that contains something improper.  Enhanced status code 5.6.0 is
to be used if no other code is more specific.</td> <td>?</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>4.2</td> <td>The MSA MUST ensure that all domains in the
envelope are fully-qualified.</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>4.2</td> <td>If the MSA examines or alters the message text in
way, except to add trace header fields [RFC 821 / RFC 2821], it MUST
ensure that all domains in address header fields are
fully-qualified.</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>4.2</td> <td>Reply code 554 is to be used to reject a MAIL
FROM, RCPT TO, or DATA command which contains improper domain
references.</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>5.1</td> <td>Reply code 501 is to be used to reject a MAIL FROM
or RCPT TO command that contains a detectably improper address.</td>
<td>?</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>5.1</td> <td>When addresses are resolved after submission of
the message body, reply code 554 with enhanced status code 5.6.2 is to
be used after end-of-data, if the message contains invalid addresses in
the header.</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>6.4</td> <td>Reply code 554 is used for syntactic problems in
the data.  Reply code 501 is used if the command itself is not
syntactically valid.  Reply code 550 with enhanced status code 5.7.1 is
used to reject based on the submitting user.  Reply code 550 with
enhanced status code 5.7.0 is used if the message violates site
policy.</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA MUST NOT accept ETRN. [RFC 1985]</td>
<td>Yes</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA MUST NOT send the SMTP 521 Reply Code [RFC
1845]</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.1</td> <td>The MSA MUST ensure that any address it places in
a 'Sender' field is in fact a valid mail address.</td> <td>N/A</td>
</tr>

<tr> <th colspan="3">Recommendations</th> </tr>

<tr> <td>3.2</td> <td>If an MSA is not able to determine a return path
to the submitting user, from a valid MAIL FROM, a valid source IP
address, or based on authenticated identity, then the MSA SHOULD
immediately reject the message.  A message can be immediately rejected
by returning a 550 code to the MAIL FROM command.</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>4.2</td> <td>Local conventions that permit single-level domains
SHOULD reject, rather than expand, incomplete multi-level domains.</td>
<td>?</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>5.1</td> <td>An MSA SHOULD reject messages with illegal syntax
in a sender or recipient envelope address.</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>5.1</td> <td>If the MSA examines or alters the message text in
way, except to add trace header fields, it SHOULD reject messages with
illegal address syntax in address header fields.</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>5.2</td> <td>The MSA SHOULD log message errors, especially
apparent misconfigurations of client software.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA SHOULD accept pipelining. [RFC 2197]</td>
<td>Yes</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA SHOULD send error codes. [RFC 2034]</td>
<td>No?</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA SHOULD send extended response codes. [RFC
1893]</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA SHOULD support DSN. [RFC 1891]</td>
<td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA SHOULD accept 8-bit MIME data. [RFC
1652]</td> <td>Yes?</td> </tr>

<tr> <th colspan="3">Options</th> </tr>

<tr> <td>3.2</td> <td>MTAs and MSAs MAY implement message rejection
rules that rely in part on whether the message is a submission or a
relay.</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>3.2</td> <td>Except in the case where the MSA is unable to
determine a valid return path for the message being submitted, text in
this specification which instructs an MSA to issue a rejection code MAY
be complied with by accepting the message and subsequently generating a
bounce message. (That is, if the MSA is going to reject a message for
any reason except being unable to determine a return path, it can
optionally do an immediate rejection or accept the message and then mail
a bounce.)</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>6.1</td> <td>The MSA MAY issue an error response to the MAIL
FROM command if the address in MAIL FROM appears to have insufficient
submission rights, or is not authorized with the authentication used (if
the session has been authenticated).  Reply code 550 with enhanced
status code 5.7.1 is used for this purpose.</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>6.2</td> <td>The MSA MAY issue an error response to the MAIL
FROM command if the session has not been authenticated.  Reply code 530
[SMTP-AUTH] is used for this purpose.</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>6.3</td> <td>The MSA MAY issue an error response to the RCPT TO
command if inconsistent with the permissions given to the user (if the
session has been authenticated).  Reply code 550 with enhanced status
code 5.7.1 is used for this purpose.</td> <td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>6.4</td> <td>The MSA MAY issue an error response to the DATA
command or send a failure result after end-of-data if the submitted
message is syntactically invalid, or seems inconsistent with permissions
given to the user (if known), or violates site policy in some way.</td>
<td></td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA MAY support the SIZE extension. [RFC
1870]</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA MAY checkpoint. [RFC 1845]</td> <td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr> <td>7</td> <td>The MSA MAY accept binary chunked data. [RFC
1830]</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.1</td> <td>The MSA MAY add or replace the 'Sender' field, if
the identity of the sender is known and this is not given in the 'From'
field.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.2</td> <td>The MSA MAY add a 'Date' field to the submitted
message, if it lacks it, or correct the 'Date' field if it does not
conform to [RFC 822/2822/1123] syntax.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.3</td> <td>The MSA MAY add or replace the 'Message-ID' field,
if it lacks it, or it is not valid syntax (as defined by [RFC
822/2822/1123]).</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.4</td> <td>The MSA MAY apply transfer encoding to the message
according to MIME conventions, if needed and not harmful to the MIME
type.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.5</td> <td>The MSA MAY (digitally) sign or otherwise add
authentication information to the message.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.6</td> <td>The MSA MAY encrypt the message for transport to
reflect organizational policies.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.7</td> <td>The MSA MAY resolve aliases (CNAME records) for
domain names, in the envelope and optionally in address fields of the
header, subject to local policy.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>8.8</td> <td>The MSA MAY rewrite local parts and/or domains, in
the envelope and optionally in address fields of the header, according
to local policy.</td> <td>No</td> </tr>
