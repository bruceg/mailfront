<h2><a href="mailfront.html">mailfront</a></h2>

<h1>Plugin API</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Plugins hook into the mail system at 5 main points:</p>

<ol> <li>when the system is started or reset,</li> <li>when the sender
address is received,</li> <li>when a recipient address is received,</li>
<li>when data is received, and</li> <li>when the message is
completed.</li> </ol>

<p>At each of these events, mailfront goes through the list of loaded
plugins. For each plugin that has a handler for such an event, mailfront
calls that handler.  If the handler returns no response, control passes
to the next handler, otherwise no further handlers are called.  If the
returned code was an error, it is passed back to the protocol
immediately, which will present it to the client.  If the sender or
recipient handlers of all the plugins return no response, the address is
considered rejected, and it is not passed on to the back end. This is
done to prevent the default configuration from being an open relay.
Plugins may modify the sender or recipient address, as well as the
message body.</p>

<p>A <a href="plugin-template.c">template</a> plugin is included as a
starting point for developing new plugins.</p>

<h2>Plugin Structure</h2>

<p>A mailfront plugin needs to define exactly one public symbol,
"<tt>plugin</tt>".  All other public symbols are ignored.  That symbol
is to be defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
struct plugin plugin = {
  .version = PLUGIN_VERSION,
  .flags = 0,
  .init = init,
  .helo = helo,
  .reset = reset,
  .sender = sender,
  .recipient = recipient,
  .data_start = data_start,
  .data_block = data_block,
  .message_end = message_end,
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>All items in this structure except for <tt>.version</tt> may be
omitted if they are not needed.  The <tt>.version</tt> field is a
constant set to prevent loading of plugins that were built for an
incompatible API.  The <tt>.flags</tt> field controls how certain parts
of the plugin are called, and may be zero or more flags values (see
below) ored together.  The remainder of the fields are hook functions
which, if present, are called at the appropriate times in the message
handling process.</p>

<p>Note that backend modules have identical structure to plugins
described here, except that the single required public symbol is named
<tt>backend</tt> instead of <tt>plugin</tt>.  The backend hook functions
are also always the last ones called (with the exception of
<tt>data_start</tt> described below).  Protocol modules have an entirely
different structure.</p>

<h3>Flags</h3>

<dl>

<dt><tt>FLAG_NEED_FILE</tt></dt> <dd>If set, a temporary file is created
and all message data is written to it.  The file descriptor for this
temporary file is passed to the <tt>.data_start</tt> and
<tt>.message_end</tt> hooks.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Hook Functions</h2>

<p>All hook functions return a <tt>response</tt> pointer or
<tt>NULL</tt>.  This structure consists of two elements: an unsigned
SMTP response code <tt>number</tt> and an ASCII <tt>message</tt>.  If
the plugin returns a NULL response, processing continues to the next
plugin in the chain.  If the plugin returns a response and either the
response number is greater than or equal to 400 (ie an error) or the
hook is short-circuiting (as indicated below), then no further hooks in
the chain are called.  If the response was an error, the error is passed
back through the protocol, otherwise processing continues to the
backend.  Protocols that do not use the SMTP numbers (such as QMTP) will
translate the number into something appropriate.</p>

<p>All string parameters are passed as type <tt>str*</tt> and are
modifiable.  If their value is changed, all subsequent plugins and the
backend will see the modified form, as will the protocol module.  See
the <a href="http://untroubled.org/bglibs/docs/group__str.html">bglibs
str</a> documentation module for functions to use in manipulating these
objects.</p>

<p>Be aware that the <tt>sender</tt> and <tt>recipient</tt> hooks may be
called before the message data is handled (as with the SMTP protocol) or
after (as with the QMQP and QMTP protocol).  In either case, the
<tt>reset</tt> hook will always be called at least once before the
message is started, and the <tt>message_end</tt> hook is called after
the message has been completely transmitted.<p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>const response* init(void)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook is called
once after all the plugins have been loaded.</dd>

<dt><tt>const response* helo(str* hostname)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook is
called when the SMTP <tt>HELO</tt> or <tt>EHLO</tt> commands are issued.
As yet nothing actually uses the <tt>hostname</tt> string.  Other
protocols will not call this hook.</dd>

<dt><tt>const response* reset(void)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook is called
when preparing to start a new message, with the intent that all modules
will flush any data specific to the message, as well as after error
responses to the sender address or data.</dd>

<dt><tt>const response* sender(str* address)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook is
called after a sender email address is transmitted by the client, and is
called exactly once per message.  This chain short-circuits on non-error
response.</dd>

<dt><tt>const response* recipient(str* address)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook
is called after a sender email address is transmitted by the client, and
may be called zero or more times per message.  This chain short-circuits
on non-error responses.</dd>

<dt><tt>const response* data_start(int fd)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook is
called when the sender starts transmitting the message data.  Note that
the backend is initialized <i>before</i> calling the plugin hooks, in
order that plugins may send extra header data to the backend in this
hook.</dd>

<dt><tt>const response* data_block(const char* bytes, unsigned long
len)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook is called as blocks of data are received
from the sender.</dd>

<dt><tt>const response* message_end(int fd)</tt></dt> <dd>This hook is
called when the message has been completely transmitted by the
sender.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Session Data</h2>

<p>The <tt>session</tt> structure contains all the current session data,
including pointers to the protocol module, the backend module,
environment variables, temporary message file descriptor, and internal
named strings and numbers.  Plugins may use these internal named data
items to store information for internal use or to pass to other plugins
with the following functions.  Note that the string and number tables
are independent and may contain items with the same names without
conflicts.  The named strings work like environment variables but are
not exposed when subprograms are executed.  The numbers work similarly,
but the data type is <tt>unsigned long</tt> instead of a string
pointer.</p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>const char* session_protocol(void)</tt></dt> <dd>Returns the
name of the protocol front end module.</tt>

<dt><tt>void session_delnum(const char* name)</tt></dt> <dd>Delete the
named number from the session.</dd>

<dt><tt>void session_delstr(const char* name)</tt></dt> <dd>Delete the
named string from the session.</dd>

<dt><tt>unsigned long session_getnum(const char* name, unsigned long
dflt)</tt></dt> <dd>Get the named number from the session.  If the name
is not present, <tt>dflt</tt> is returned.</dd>

<dt><tt>int session_hasnum(const char* name, unsigned long*
num)</tt></dt> <dd>Returns true if the named number is present in the
session.</dd>

<dt><tt>const char* session_getstr(const char* name)</tt></dt> <dd>Fetch
the named string from the session.  If the name is not present,
<tt>NULL</tt> is returned.</dd>

<dt><tt>void session_setnum(const char* name, unsigned long
value)</tt></dt> <dd>Set the named number in the session.</dd>

<dt><tt>void session_setstr(const char* name, const char*
value)</tt></dt> <dd>Set the named string in the session.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Library Functions</h2>

<dl>

<dt><tt>const response* backend_data_block(const char* data, unsigned
long len)</tt></dt> <dd>This routine writes a block of data directly to
the backend.  It takes care of handling both writing to the temporary
file if it was created or writing directly to the backend module.</dd>

<dt><tt>const char* getprotoenv(const char* name)</tt></dt> <dd>Fetch
the environment variable with the given name prefixed by the value of
<tt>$PROTO</tt>.  For example, if <tt>$PROTO</tt> is set to
"<tt>TCP</tt>" (as with <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcpserver.html">tcpserver</a>), then
<tt>getprotoenv("LOCALIP")</tt> will get the environment variable named
"<tt>TCPLOCALIP</tt>".</dd>

<dt><tt>int scratchfile(void)</tt></dt> <dd>Create a new temporary file
descriptor opened for reading and writing.  The temporary filename is
unlinked before returning so that the temporary file will be deleted as
soon as it is closed (by the plugin or when mailfront exits).</dd>

<!-- <dt><tt></tt></dt> <dd></dd> -->

</dl>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<h3>Rewriting the message body</h3>

<p>Plugins that need to rewrite the message of the body should do so in
the <tt>message_end</tt> hook.  Create a new temporary file descriptor
with <tt>scratchfile()</tt> and write the complete new message to it.
Then move the new temporary file over to the existing one with the
following sequence:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
dup2(tmpfd, fd);
close(tmpfd);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Be sure to rewind the original file descriptor with
<tt>lseek(fd,SEEK_SET,0)</tt> before using it, since the file position
will normally be at the very end of the data.</p>
