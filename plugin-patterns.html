<p>The pattern matching feature of mailfront provides an ability for
rejecting messages based on simple patterns in their content.  If
<tt>$PATTERNS</tt> is set, the named file is loaded and and parsed (see
below), and pattern matching is enabled.  No more than
<tt>$PATTERNS_LINEMAX</tt> bytes (defaults to 256) are added to the line
buffer before the pattern matching is done.  If any pattern matches, the
message data is rejected with a message taken from
<tt>$PATTERNS_RESP</tt> (defaults to "<tt>This message contains
prohibited content</tt>").<p>

<p>The patterns file contains a list of standard glob-style patterns.
Each line of the file starts with a control character, which is
<i>not</i> part of the pattern itself: <dl>

<dt><tt>#</tt> <dd>Comment line, ignored.

<dt><tt>=</tt> <dd>Sets the response text given when a message is
rejected.  All following patterns use this response until the next
response line.

<dt><tt>:</tt> <dd>The pattern will be applied only in the header.

<dt><tt>\</tt> <dd>The pattern will be applied only after a blank line.

<dt>Anything else <dd>A normal pattern, applied to any non-blank line.

</dl></p>

<p>The following patterns list is a much simplified version of Russell
Nelson's <a
href="http://qmail.org/qmail-smtpd-viruscan-1.1.patch">qmail-smtpd virus
scan patch</a>.  In particular, it doesn't actually do any kind of
checking if the blank line really marked a MIME boundary or not.</p>
