<h1>Standard Handlers</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The most useful protocol front-ends and delivery back-ends are joined
by a set of standard handlers.  These handlers integrate the operation
of <a href="mailrules.html">mail rules</a>, <a
href="patterns.html">pattern matching</a>, several miscellaneous options
and back-end validation and delivery functions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The following features are common to all front-ends that use the
standard handlers: <ul>

<li>Validates senders and recipients according to <a
href="mailrules.html">mail rules</a> processing.

<li>Requires all addresses except the null sender to contain a fully
qualified domain name.

<li>If <tt>$RELAYCLIENT</tt> is set, all recipient addresses not
rejected by mail rules are allowed, and its contents are appended to
each recipient address.  Back-end validation is omitted.

<li>If <tt>$REQUIRE_AUTH</tt> is set, all mail is rejected unless either
<tt>$RELAYCLIENT</tt> is set or the sender authenticates.

<li>Rejects messages that exceed <tt>$DATABYTES</tt> bytes in length.

<li>Counts the number of "<tt>Received:</tt>" and
"<tt>Delivered-To:</tt>" headers, and rejects the message if more than
<tt>$MAXHOPS</tt> of either are seen (defaults to 100).

<li>Optionally adds a fixup "<tt>Received:</tt>" header for hosts that
have different incoming and outgoing hostnames or IPs.  Set
<tt>$FIXUP_RECEIVED_HOST</tt> and <tt>$FIXUP_RECEIVED_IP</tt> if you
want this header added.

<li>Optional user-specified headers may be added by setting
<tt>$HEADER_ADD</tt>.

<li>If <tt>$CVM_LOOKUP</tt> is set, recipients are sent to the named CVM
to see if they are valid.  If <tt>CVM_LOOKUP_SECRET</tt> or
<tt>$LOOKUP_SECRET</tt> are set and not empty, the value is sent as a
single credential to the CVM.</tt>

<li>If <tt>$MAXRCPTS</tt> is set, the number of recipients allowed per
message is limited to that number.</tt>

<li>Support for <a href="patterns.html">pattern matching</a> in the
message data.

<li>Support for adding additional plugins at run time.  Set
<tt>$PLUGINS</tt> to a colon separated list of plugin names, and
optionally set <tt>$MODULE_PATH</tt> to the directory in which those
plugins are contained.

</ul></p>
