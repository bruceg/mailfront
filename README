mailfront
Mail server network protocol front-ends

This is mailfront, a package containing customizeable network front-ends
for mail servers.  Right now the only protocols that are handled are
SMTP and POP3, but it may be extended to deal with QMQP, QMTP, and
potentially IMAP.

Two SMTP back-ends are provided.  One delivers mail to qmail-queue,
mimicking most of the behavior of qmail-smtpd, with the addition of
support for SMTP AUTH.  The other rejects all SMTP commands if
$SMTPREJECT is set, and execs its command line otherwise (in order to
run the above program).

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.
