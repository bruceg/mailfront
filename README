mailfront
Mail server network protocol front-ends

This is mailfront, a package containing customizeable network front-ends
for mail servers.  Right now the only protocol that is handled is SMTP,
but it may be extended to deal with QMQP, QMTP, and even POP3 or IMAP.

Two back-ends are provided.  One delivers mail to qmail-queue, mimicking
most of the behavior of qmail-smtpd.  The other rejects all SMTP commands
if $SMTPREJECT is set, and execs its command line otherwise (in order to
run the above program).

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.

Development versions of mailfront are available via anonymous CVS.
