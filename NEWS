  SMTP protocol when handling the SIZE=# parameter.

- Reversed the order of cvm-validate and qmail-validate in the wrapper

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0

Mailfront has been rewritten to be totally modular.  The core mailfront
program loads the protocol, backend, and all plugin behaviors at run
time from shared objects.

The previous commands, such as smtpfront-qmail, are now shell script
wrappers for the main "mailfront" command, and as such are depricated in
favor of using "mailfront" directly.  The *front-qmail wrappers preload
all the plugins that were previously compiled into the corresponding
programs:

	check-fqdn counters mailrules relayclient cvm-validate
	qmail-validate add-received patterns accept-sender

NOTE: The *front-reject backends have been dropped in favor of a plugin.
In addition, the $REQUIRE_AUTH feature has been moved to another plugin.
If you used this backend or feature you will need to adjust your
configuration accordingly.

Changes in version 0.98.1

- Fixed the $REQUIRE_AUTH feature to properly check for $RELAYCLIENT
  being set.

ossi@FutureQuest.net  http://www.FutureQuest.net/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.98

- Added enhanced mail system status codes (RFC 1893/2034).

- Added support for rejecting all mail unless client is authenticated
  (either as a relay client or with SMTP authentication) if
  $REQUIRE_AUTH is set.

- Full domain names are now required in all addresses except for the
  null sender.

- Removed the "bounce must have a single recipient" rule, as it is
  currently causing more problems (with address checkers) than it is
  solving (spammers no longer use this technique).

- Fixed one-off bug in counting recipients for $MAXRCPTS.

- Truncate UIDL responses to 70 characters as per RFC 1939.

- Added QMQP and QMTP "reject" front ends, for completeness.

The enhanced mail system status codes together with the $REQUIRE_AUTH
change should make smtpfront compliant with RFC 2476's requirements for
a "message submission agent", suitable for use on TCP port 587.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.97

  taken from $QQERRMSG_#.

- Clear session timeouts (via alarm) before executing authenticated
  commands in imapfront-auth and pop3front-auth.

- Fixed typo in the CVM lookup code that would prevent the proper
  operation of lookup secrets.  Thanks Dale Woolridge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.96

- Switched Pattern matching from the simpler mechanism (originated in
  multilog) to standard shell glob.

  characters, or to strip source routing addresses.

- Fixed smtpfront-reject crashing on receipt of EHLO.
  Thanks Janos Farkas.

- Fixed extern/static conflict in smtp-respond.c.  Thanks Gerrit Pape.

NOTE: The pattern matching change has the (small) potential to break
existing rules' behavior, if the rules were depending on specific
behavior of the more simplistic pattern matching used previously.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.95

  rule, after checking for sender rules.

  like the latest CVM code, falling back to $LOOKUP_SECRET if that isn't
  set.

- Added seperate $AUTH_TIMEOUT and $AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT overrides for
  the authentication front-ends (imapfront-auth and pop3front-auth).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.92

- Fixed bug in QMQP front-end that prevented it from accepting relayed
  messages (relayclient wasn't getting set properly).

- Added qmqpfront-echo and qmtpfront-echo test front-ends, for
  completeness.

- Fixed bug in pattern handling that would cause a bogus "out of memory"
  error if the patterns file had a blank line.

- Fixed bug:  Only set $MAILDIR in imapfront-auth if the CVM set it.
  Thanks Charlie Brady.

Changes in version 0.91

- Fixed a bug in the CVM lookup code that would cause failures if

  Courier-IMAP's imapd.  Thanks Bernhard Graf.
