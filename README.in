This is mailfront, a package containing customizable network front-ends
for mail servers.  It contains complete SMTP, QMQP, QMTP, and POP3
front ends as well as an authentication module for IMAP.  The mail
delivery front ends also contain internal address filtering features.

Two SMTP back ends are provided.  One delivers mail to qmail-queue,
mimicking most of the behavior of qmail-smtpd, with the addition of
support for SMTP AUTH.  The other writes accepted messages to individual
files in a named directory.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.
